A simple PowerShell module for doing simple arithmetic operations with Vectors and matrices
===========================================================================================

This is just a kind of "proof of concept" that these kind of operations are possible with PowerShell  

Not that anyone would doubt this but its more about the dealing with two dimensional arrays  
and classes that represents vectors and matrices

A few of the operations that are possible:  
\>Calculating the length of a vector  
\>Calculating the determinant of a 2x2 matrice  
\>Multiplying two matrices
