A simple PowerShell module for doing simple arithmetic operations with Vectors and Matrices
===========================================================================================

This is just a kind of "proof of concept" that these kind of operations are possible with PowerShell  

Not that anyone would doubt this but its more about the dealing with two dimensional arrays  
and classes that represents vectors and matrices. I have come up with a few nice techniques  
that can be used in other circumstances of course so intermediate and even experts might  
still learn something new (like using properties with the type of an array of another  
class or using a module with just class definitions inside another module or a test)  

A few of the operations that are possible:  
\>Calculating the length of a vector  
\>Calculating the determinant of a 2x2 matrice  
\>Multiplying two matrices
